integration: behaviours/events
question: are they mandatory for now (just seeking for an execution) ?
          maybe we can leave that for later as we are primarily interested in execution ?

integration: remove Utils.v and use the files in Lib?
             remove Tmp.v in I2MP as well

integration: modules interface for RC instance?
             but is it relevant? cf linking problems

question: should I stick to Arthur's file organisation
          or progressivelly match the rest of the repo (CS.v, Machine.v, etc.)?
          Arthur's answer: it hasn't been very much thought of anyway, it is a mess?
          hard to give a clear answer
          anyway it has been modified
