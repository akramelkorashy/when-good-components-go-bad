  **[When Good Components Go Bad: Formally Secure Compilation Despite
     Dynamic Compromise](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00588)**.
     In 25th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security
     (CCS 2018), October 2018.

### Prerequisites ###

This development requires Coq v8.7.1 to work, as well as the following libraries:
- [Mathematical Components](https://math-comp.github.io/math-comp/) 1.6.4
- [Extensional Structures](https://github.com/arthuraa/extructures) 0.1
- [CoqUtils](https://github.com/arthuraa/coq-utils/releases/tag/v0.1) 0.1

### Replaying the proofs ###

    $ make -j4

### Running the tests ###

Our tests are known to work with [QuickChick](https://github.com/QuickChick/QuickChick) branch 8.7 and
OCaml from 4.02.3 to 4.06.

Running the tests (to be simplified):

    $ make clean
    $ make -j4
    $ ./run_extracted_examples.sh --force-extraction
    $ rm sfi_safety_properties.exe
    $ ./run_sfi_tests.sh

More thorough mutation tests are on the `nora-testing-experiments` branch.

### Top-level theorems ###

At the top level, the development provides high-level proofs with the following
entry points:
- `RSC_DC_MD.v`: generic secure compilation proof
  against the assumptions in `RSC_DC_MD_Sigs.v` (Section 3.5)
- `RSC_DC_MD_Instance.v`: an instantiation of the assumptions
  from `RSC_DC_MD_Sigs.v` to our compilation chain  (Section 4.3)
- `RSC_DC.v`: general proofs about the class of properties preserved
  by RSC^DC (Appendix A)
- `RSC_DC_4_compcert.v`: proofs in `RSC_DC.v` adapted to the general CompCert
  trace model (Appendix A)

The correspondences between the main definitions and results in the paper and
in Coq are as follows.

Definition 3.2: Robustly Safe Compilation with Dynamic Compromise (RSC^DC)
- `RSC_DC.RSC_dc` in the simple trace model
- `RSC_DC_4_compcert.RSC_dc` in the CompCert trace model

Definition 3.3: Robustly Safe Compilation with Dynamic Compromise and Mutual
Distrust (RSC^DC_MD)
- `RSC_DC_MD.RSC_DC_MD`

Definition A.1: Z_P class of safety properties preserved by RSC^DC
- `RSC_DC.Z_class` (proof-friendly definition)
  and `RSC_DC.Z_p_equivalent`
  (proof of equivalence between the proof-friendly and the paper definitions)
  in the simple trace model
- `RSC_DC_4_compcert.Z_class` (proof-friendly definition)
  and `RSC_DC_4_compcert.Z_p_equivalent`
  (proof of equivalence between the proof-friendly and the paper definitions)
  in the CompCert trace model

Theorem A.2: RSC^DC characterization via Z_P
- `RSC_DC.main_thm` in the simple trace model
- `RSC_DC_4_compcert.main_thm` in the CompCert trace model
